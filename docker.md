# What is Docker?
- Docker is an engine that allows you to run containers. Containers have many advantages, including:

    - Code and dependancies are packaged together, so software runs more reliably in different environments
    - Containers are a standard unit of software
    - As standalone executable packages, containers include everything needed to run the application
    - Containers are lightweight in comparison to virtual machines
    
 
## Dockerfile
- Text document that contains all the commands and instructions necessary to build a Docker Image. See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) a Dockerfile Reference

## Docker Image
- Executable packages comprised of code, dependancies, libraries, a runtime, environment variables, and configuration files. 
Very similar to a virtual machine snapshot.

## Docker Container
- A runtime instance of a Docker Image. This is what the image becomes when executed in memory.
